%   Two Spots                           
%   
%   Creates a distance matrix based on two standardized Gaussian
%   distributions separated in 2-D space by a specified radius.
%
%   Ins:
%   m         -- number of points in each cluster
%   radius    -- radius of separation
%   
%   
%   Outs:
%   Distance  -- distance matrix
%   labels    -- actual classification
%   xy        -- actual data points
